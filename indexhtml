<p id="G">This is a website dedicated o the project company under the name of Grimm With A Happy Ending. Grimm With A Happy Ending was created by Janayia Artis and Rivka Bella R. Our company is dedicated in creating interactive text based games that allow children to be able to see themselves in the place of video game characters. We allow the user to create their own character and to choose their own story.</p>
<p id="B">The first two buttons are the gender and skin color buttons. Not a lot of American mainstream stories have woman or character who do not identify within the binary, and there are even less people of color as the main protagonist. By giving the user this choose they aren't limited to societies default options. The next two buttons are the are jobs and settings. We didn't want the user to just choose a random story, we wanted the user to go through randomly generate stories that matched the user's interests. By doing this we allow the user to be exposed to different stories that they may not have not chosen on their own.</p>
