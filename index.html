<p id="G">This is a website dedicated o the project company under the name of Grimm With A Happy Ending. Grimm With A Happy Ending was created by Janayia Artis and Rivka Bella Rabaev. Our company is dedicated in creating interactive text based games that allow children to be able to see themselves in the place of video game characters. We allow the user to create their own character and to choose their own story. This is the final project we decided to do in our summer immersion program Girls Who Code. We were given about two weeks to think of a project, plan it out, and to create it. In that short amount of time we were able to come up with our game. This website is a placeholder for our project, a platform to allow others to view our project, and a place to talk a little more about ourselves, our project, and our struggles. We hope you enjoy what we have been able to create./p>
<p id="B">The first two buttons are the gender and skin color buttons. Not a lot of American mainstream stories have woman or character who do not identify within the binary, and there are even less people of color as the main protagonist. By giving the user this choose they aren't limited to societies default options. The next two buttons are the are jobs and settings. We didn't want the user to just choose a random story, we wanted the user to go through randomly generate stories that matched the user's interests. By doing this we allow the user to be exposed to different stories that they may not have not chosen on their own.</p>
<p id="S">When you start playing the game the beginning pages of the stories are played out in an animated scene. In order to have motion we used a gif and took every different movement and turned them into pictures. We then tell the character to switch between the pictures to make it seem like the character is moving in the scene. This brilliant idea was thanks to Rivka Bella. After the beginning scenes you are given choices. With each choice it takes you to a different part of the game. With each choice it effects the ending that you recieve. Right now in our most viable product(MVP) we only have one storyline that you can follow. Given the oppurtunity we would like to add more options and storylines.</p>
<p id="H">A lot of the game involves a lot of recycling of code, images, and backgrounds. We didn't really have a lot of time to create a lot of diversity within the coding and images. We had to create a lot of broadcasts to allow for certain features to function. Have as many broadcasts as we do made it hard to know what is wrong when the game glitches out, and it made it really hard when trying to test the game because it can be really slow. On top of having a ton of broadcasts we also had a ton of hidden things in the background. Having so many things running also contributed to how fast the program functioned. This also made it sort of difficult when you wanted certain things to appear. There was such a clear vision what the game was to include made it so there was very little room for compromise or mistakes.</p>
